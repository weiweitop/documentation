<h2 id="loan-repayment-installments-amount-deduction-during-leave-settlement">Loan Repayment Installments Amount Deduction during Leave Settlement</h2>

<h3 id="july-2018-10375">July 2018 (#10375)</h3>

<p>Usually, when an employee goes for leave, his loan repayment amount for leave start month is only deducted while processing leave settlement. But now, with this new feature, the loan repayment amount can be deducted for not only the leave start month but also for leave end month as per settings done in Application parameter. Furthermore, there is an additional functionality where if the days in next month falls less than 15 days, then the deduction is not taken.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this functionality, a new parameter <strong>Loan Installment Deductions in Leave Settlement</strong> is added in the <strong>Application parameter&gt; LOAN-1</strong> tab. It consists of three options as:</p>

<table>

<thead>

<tr>

<th>Sl. No</th>

<th>Parameter</th>

<th>Description</th>

</tr>

</thead>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>Loan Deductions till Payroll End Date of Leave Start Date</td>

<td>

By default, the parameter is set to ‚ÄòLoan Deductions till Payroll End Date of Leave Start Date‚Äô. Loan deduction in leave settlement works as normal in this case.

For instance, if an employee is going for leave from May 15<sup>th</sup> to June 15<sup>th</sup>, then if this parameter is set, then the loan repayment amount for the month of May only is deducted.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Loan Deductions till Payroll End Date of Leave To Date</td>

<td>

Loan amount is deducted till the payroll end date of the ‚ÄòLeave to date‚Äô month.

For instance, if an employee is going for leave from May 15<sup>th</sup> to June 15<sup>th</sup>, then if this parameter is set, then the loan repayment amount for the month of May and June is deducted.

</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Loan Deductions till Payroll End Date of Leave To Date (Cutoff 15th)</td>

<td>

Loan amount is deducted till the payroll end date month of the Leave to date only if the settlement to date falls after 15th day of the Leave to date.

In this case, if the ‚ÄòLeave to date‚Äô falls within 15<sup>th</sup> date of the next month, loan amount is deducted only for previous month.

For instance, if an employee is going for leave from May 15<sup>th</sup> to June 15<sup>th</sup>, then if this parameter is set, then the loan repayment amount for the month of May will be deducted and if the leave to date falls below 15<sup>th</sup> of next month, then the amount is not deducted for the month of June.

</td>

</tr>

<h2 id="vacation-eligibility-based-on-service-days">Vacation eligibility based on service days.</h2>

<h3 id="dec-2018-----12943">Dec 2018  - # 12943</h3>

<p>For the client, for a few employees, vacation days or eligibility will change as per the service days of employee.</p>

<p>Below lists the slab for accrual.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>0-3 Years &gt; 22 working Days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3-6 Years &gt; 24 working Days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>6-10 Years &gt; 26 working Days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>10-20 Years &gt; 28 working Days</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>20 Years and above &gt; 30 working Days</p>

<p>Leave Days will be accrued on Pro-data basis, which means if an employee‚Äôs slab changes at the mid of a month. His/ her balance should be calculated pro-data basis.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: If an employee completes the 3 years by 15th of June, his leave accrual should be 15 days with 22 working days and rest with 24 working Days.</p>

<p>In both ESS and HR Works Leave application, leave balance need to show as per the above accrual method. The client needs to show the leave balance as of leave start date</p>

<p>For this, a new parameter (<strong>Apply Prorata Calculation in Vacation</strong>) is added to <strong>Application parameter¬†¬ª</strong> <strong>LV-1</strong>. If the value of this parameter is set to ‚ÄòYes‚Äô, leave days will be accrued based on pro-data basis. Leave balance in leave application will be shown as per this accrual method.</p>

<h2 id="leave-settlement-pay-on-calendar-days">Leave Settlement pay on Calendar days</h2>

<h3 id="dec-2018-----11866">Dec 2018  - # 11866</h3>

<p>Vacation pay is calculated based on the calculation criteria set in vacation codes alone. The client requires that it should be calculated based on the daily rate policy applicable to the employee.</p>

<p>To customize the system as per client‚Äôs requirement, a new application parameter (<strong>Leave Advance Pay Calculation</strong>) is added to the <strong>LV-1</strong> tab of the <strong>Application parameter</strong>. If its value is set as <strong>Daily Rate Basis Till Leave To Date</strong>, then the vacation pay calculation in leave settlement will change and new calculation will be as follows:</p>

<p>Vacation pay = sum (salary for pay components in vacation pay from leave start period to leave to date) - sum (salary for pay components in vacation pay from leave start period to leave from date)</p>

<h2 id="leave-settlement-recovery-changes">Leave settlement Recovery changes</h2>

<h3 id="oct-2018-11068"><strong>**</strong>Oct 2018 (#11068)**</h3>

<p>In HR Works, when an employee goes on vacation and requests for Leave salary advance, he/ she will be paid the salary till the leave start date and leave salary for the leave days. The leave salary consists of gross salary excluding COLA, OTHER and MOBILE allowance. These allowances will be paid for the leave days along with month end payroll. Leave salary paid to the employee will be considered as leave salary advance and it will be recovered from the subsequent payrolls.</p>

<p>In case if an employee has got any additional payments such as OT, Bonus or allowances (COLA, OTHER and MOBILE), those payments will be made only after recovering the leave salary advance paid to the employee. The client now requires that the recovery be made only from the paid leave salary components and if any additional payments are there, they should not be touched and have to be paid as usual.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><strong>Employee Salary</strong>- Basic: 500, HRA: 200, TRA: 50, OTH: 50</p>

<p><strong>Leave</strong> ‚Äì 16th May 2018 to 19 June 2018 (25 days)</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/prod-enhance-image21.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Another requirement of the client is to have an option to specify how arrears are recalculated against salary revisions.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For Full Accrual Days Balance:</strong> current functionality/ Default setting</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>From Salary Revision Effective Date</strong>: recalculate accrual only from salary revision period</p>

<h3 id="july-2018-10175">July 2018 (#10175)</h3>

<p>Normally, if an employee is delayed from annual leave, system will be extending the leave with annual leave itself. But, if the employee doesn‚Äôt have sufficient annual leave balance, then the system will split up the leave extension in to two- one with available annual leave balance and the rest with unpaid leave (salary will be zero and accruals are excluded for these days).</p>

<p>This functionality is achieved by introducing a new parameter <strong>Default Leave Type in Leave Return Screen for Delayed Return if Balance Exceeds</strong> in Leave Master for leaves having leave type category ‚ÄòAdjust Vacation Balance‚Äô <img src="images/prod-enhance-image23.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>While creating Leave Return, the user can create a new leave based on ‚Äòdefault leave type in leave return screen for delayed leave‚Äô if employee have enough leave balance. Otherwise, return leave will be split in to two leaves, first leave days will be leave balance days, second leave will be difference between total leave days and leave balance. User will not be able to modify this leave data.</p>

<h2 id="time-lieu-expiration">Time Lieu Expiration</h2>

<h3 id="july-2018-8245">July 2018 (#8245)</h3>

<p>There was no expiry for employee‚Äôs Time in Liew hours. On the <strong>Application parameter&gt;LV-1 tab,</strong> a new parameter (<strong>Cut-off for availing Compensatory Off Balance)</strong> is added to set a cut-off value so that the Time in Lieu hours will expire after a predefined value (Days).</p>

<p><img src="images/prod-enhance-image24.png" alt="" /><br />
The values available for selection are listed below. These values refer to the time period for the expiration of the compensatory off. For instance, If the value is set as 30 days, the employee will have to avail this compensatory off within this 30 days‚Äô time, otherwise it will get expired and so it will not be available for him.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>30 Days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>60 Days</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Till end of Next Month</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Till end of next 2 months</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Till end of Current Month</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Max -ve allowed Compensatory-Off Balance</strong> parameter in <strong>Application parameter&gt;LV-1</strong> tab is used to validate the leave days while taking the compensatory off Type Leave.</p>

<p>For instance, on assigning a value 5 for this parameter, while applying for compensatory off, even though the leave balance is 17, an additional 5 leaves also can be applied.<img src="images/prod-enhance-image25.png" alt="C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Temp\SNAGHTML38435d0c.PNG" /></p>

<h2 id="probation-notification-with-attachment">Probation notification with Attachment</h2>

<h3 id="july-2018-9955">July 2018 (#9955)</h3>

<p>Here the customization requirement was such that an email notification should be send to the Line Manager and head of department 30 days before the probation end date with Probation evaluation form. The header details of Probation need to be filled based on employee‚Äôs data. The probation notification to Managers should only be send once.</p>

<p>The solution approach is done in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This feature is handled by introducing a new alert type in Alert Configuration screen - ‚ÄòProbation Alert Prior to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probation End Date‚Äô.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The custom report should be made for Probation Report and this will be available for selection in Alert</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Configuration.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Alert functionality is moved from <strong>HRW License Manager</strong> to <strong>Email Attendance Details</strong> service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new key is added in HRW License Manager and Email Attendance Details ‚Äì <strong>EnableAlert</strong> which will be <strong>true in former and false in later (by default</strong>). This parameter, if set as true, Alert functionality will be working as usual. This key <strong>should not be</strong> set as true in both services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The probation report uses <strong>Report Emailer</strong> application for mail sending, like the Attendance Report emailing functionality. So the URL to Report Emailer exe should be set in service‚Äôs config file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The key <strong>TimeInterval</strong> used in License Manager is also added in Email Attendance Details service (default as 1)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For employee photograph upload, a new parameter named <strong>Maximum Size of Employee Photo in KBs</strong> is introduced on the <strong>Application parameter¬†¬ª HRW-1</strong> tab. Users can specify the maximum upload limit for employee photograph in kilobytes.</p>

<p>For the fields on the personal records field groups for which you want to have file upload size limit, do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A query needs to be executed in the HR Works DB, in which the type and size of the file to be uploaded can be specified.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="july-2019---14583">July 2019 - #14583</h3>

<p>A loan budget feature is introduced in the system. The loan budget amount of the organisation is saved in the system. The approvers have the option to view the loan budget amount and total outstanding loan amount of the company. While approving a loan request, approvers must check whether the existing loan budget of the company is enough to meet the loan amount. Thus, approver can determine whether to approve the request or to keep pending the request.</p>

<p>For implementing this change, follow the below steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Execute a query to enable the Application parameter. New parameters are introduced in the LOAN-1 Tab of Application parameter which are ‚ÄòIndividual Loan Wise Limit‚Äô and ‚ÄòLoan Budget Exceeding Validation‚Äô.</p>

<h3 id="dec-2018--11127">Dec 2018 # 11127</h3>

<p>When role delegation request is placed with and through the leave application transaction, the leave request is approved first, then the role delegation request is sent to the delegate for acceptance.</p>

<p>The client needs to have control over the sequence in which the leave and role delegation requests are processed as follows:</p>

<p>When an employee places role delegation request with and through the leave application request:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The delegate should accept role delegation request.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leave Request should be approved through work flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If leave request is rejected by approvers, the role delegation should be cancelled.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To implement these changes, the following are done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A new parameter (<strong>Role Delegation Validation in Leave Request</strong>) is added to the <strong>HSS-1</strong> tab of the <strong>HRW + Application parameters</strong> screen. Users can set any of the following values for this parameter:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Not Mandatory</strong>: When this is selected, approvers can approve the leave application transaction regardless of the acceptance or rejection of role delegation request.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Mandatory At 1st Approval</strong>: When this is selected, it becomes mandatory that the role delegation request be accepted before the first-level approver can approve the leave application. The system displays a validation message whenever the first-level approver tries to approve the leave application if the role delegation is not accepted.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Mandatory At Final Approval</strong>: When this is selected, all approvers other than the final-level approver can approve the leave application regardless of the status of role delegation request. But it becomes mandatory that the role delegation request be accepted before the final-level approver approves the leave application. The system displays a validation message whenever the final-level approver tries to approve the leave application if the role delegation is not accepted.</p>

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: In case if the role delegation request is not accepted or rejected by the delegate, the leave application too will be rejected.</p>

<p>The client wanted to have attachment option on leave application so that approvers can attach files while approving/ rejecting the leave application of employees. For this, a new parameter ‚Äò<strong>EntityID (User Defined Fields For Leave Approval)</strong>‚Äô is added to <strong>HRW+ Application parameter¬†¬ª HSS-1</strong> tab. Users can create user defined field group on the Card Types¬†¬ª User Defined tab where they create and define fields and their data types and then set that user defined field group as the value of <strong>EntityID (User Defined Fields For Leave Approval)</strong> parameter<strong>.</strong> Refer to the screenshots below<strong>:</strong></p>

<strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>View Details</strong> link appears after the employee selects the leave type from the <strong>Leave Type</strong> drop down field.</p>

<p>Before implementing the changes requested by the client, when employees apply for any leave such as sick leave for which leave limit scheme is set, they can only view the split up of leave days (Entitled, availed, and balance) based on the previous leave requests. The data shows was not updated on the leave data (From date, To date, and/ or number of days) entered on the current leave request form.</p>

<p>A new parameter (<strong>Show Leave Days Split up for Leave Limit Scheme</strong>) is introduced in the <strong>ESS-1</strong> tab of the <strong>ESS Application parameter</strong>. Users can set the parameter value to <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong> which tells whether to allow the employees to view the split up of leave days (Entitled, availed, and balance) against the days of leave specified in the leave form.</p>

<p>When set to <strong>Yes</strong>, employees view their leave balance against the applied leave day(s) as well as the split up of leave days based on the leave limit scheme as follows.</p>
