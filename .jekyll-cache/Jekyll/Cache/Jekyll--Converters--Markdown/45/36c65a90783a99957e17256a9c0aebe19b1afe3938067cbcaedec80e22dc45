I"Ù<p>This page lists common errors and the steps needed to troubleshoot them.</p>

<h2 id="issues-building-the-site">Issues building the site</h2>

<h3 id="address-already-in-use">Address already in use</h3>

<p>When you try to build the site, you get this error in iTerm:</p>

<pre><code>jekyll 2.5.3 | Error:  Address already in use - bind(2)
</code></pre>
<p>This happens if a server is already in use. To fix this, edit your config file and change the port to a unique number.</p>

<p>If the previous server wasn‚Äôt shut down properly, you can kill the server process using these commands:</p>

<p><code>ps aux | grep jekyll</code></p>

<p>Find the PID (for example, it  looks like ‚Äú22298‚Äù).</p>

<p>Then type <code>kill -9 22298</code> where ‚Äú22298‚Äù is the PID.</p>

<p>Alternatively, type the following to stop all Jekyll servers:</p>

<pre><code>kill -9 $(ps aux | grep '[j]ekyll' | awk '{print $2}')
</code></pre>

<h3 id="shell-file-not-executable">shell file not executable</h3>

<p>If you run into permissions errors trying to run a shell script file (such as jekyllhowto-multibuild_web.sh), you may need to change the file permissions to make the sh file executable. Browse to the directory containing the shell script and run the following:</p>

<pre><code>chmod +x build_writer.sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="shell-file-not-runnable">shell file not runnable</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre using a PC, rename your shell files with a .bat extension.</p>

<h3 id="page-0-cross-references-in-the-pdf">‚Äúpage 0‚Äù cross references in the PDF</h3>

<p>If you see ‚Äúpage 0‚Äù cross-references in the PDF, the URL doesn‚Äôt exist. Check to make sure you actually included this page in the build.</p>

<p>If it‚Äôs not a page but rather a file, you need to add a <code>noExtIcon</code> class to the file so that your print stylesheet excludes the counter from it. Add <code>class="noExtIcon"</code> as an attribute to the link.</p>

<h3 id="the-pdf-is-blank">The PDF is blank</h3>

<p>Check the prince-list.txt file in the output to see if it contains links. If not, you have something wrong with the logic in the prince-list.txt file. Check the conditions.html file in your _includes to see if the audience specified in your configuration file aligns with the buildAudience in the conditions.html file</p>

<h3 id="sidebar-not-appearing">Sidebar not appearing</h3>

<p>If you build your site but the sidebar doesn‚Äôt appear, check that your page has a <code>sidebar</code> property in the frontmatter that corresponds with a sidebar in the _data folder.</p>

<h3 id="sidebar-isnt-collapsed">Sidebar isn‚Äôt collapsed</h3>

<p>If the sidebar levels aren‚Äôt collapsed, usually your JavaScript is broken somewhere. Open the JavaScript Console and look to see where the problem is. If one script breaks, then other scripts will break too, so troubleshooting it is a little tricky.</p>

<h3 id="search-isnt-working">Search isn‚Äôt working</h3>

<p>If the search isn‚Äôt working, check the JSON validity in the search.json file in your output folder. Usually something is invalid. Identify the problematic line, fix the file, or put <code>search: exclude</code> in the frontmatter of the file to exclude it from search.</p>

<h2 id="links-not-working">Links not working</h2>

<p>Make sure you add <code>{% include links.html %}</code> at the bottom of each page. Make sure your sidebar is listed in the <code>sidebars</code> property in your configuration file.</p>

<h2 id="links-include-isnt-working-correctly">Links include isn‚Äôt working correctly</h2>

<p>If you look at your HTML output and see that the links.html include at the bottom is leaving all the Markdown reference tags in the output, something is wrong with your Markdown or HTML syntax on the page. As a result, the Markdown might stop rendering.</p>

<p>For example, look at your HTML tables. If there is one tiny formatting issue (a tag not properly closed), kramdown will stop working on the file and won‚Äôt convert any other content in the file. The Markdown reference tags are just evidence that the Markdown filter stopped converting the file to HTML at this point. Fix the HTML and the Markdown will properly convert to HTML.</p>

<h2 id="building-someone-elses-project">Building Someone Else‚Äôs Project</h2>

<p>When you build someone else‚Äôs project, if the person has a Gem and Gemfile, you might get errors like this:</p>

<pre><code>WARN: Unresolved specs during Gem::Specification.reset:
      rouge (~&gt; 1.7)
      jekyll-watch (~&gt; 1.1)
WARN: Clearing out unresolved specs.
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the person had different version of Ruby gems on their computer, which get packaged into a Gemfile.</p>

<p>First run bundler to make sure the gem versions on your computer match those of the project. From the project‚Äôs directory, run the following:</p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>Then run this:</p>

<pre><code>jekyll serve --config configs/jekyll_english.yml
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can press <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> and run <code>. jekyll.sh</code> as usual.</p>

<h2 id="checking-the-version-of-jekyll">Checking the version of Jekyll</h2>

<p>You can see what version of Jekyll you have by running the following:</p>

<pre><code>jekyll -version
</code></pre>
